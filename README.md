# Coding-Test---Message-Decoder

The objective is to take a text file as an input, and decode a secret messaged. The text file reads as a number followed by a word. The numbers must be ordered into a pyramid, and the message is constructed from the ending elements of each level of the pyramid. For example:

2 orange
6 cake
4 thread
1 I
5 piano
3 like

Decodes to "I like cake".
